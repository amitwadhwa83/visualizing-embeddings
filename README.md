# Visualizing Embeddings

## Overview
This project is focused on visualizing embeddings generated from various machine learning models. Embeddings are a way to represent data in a lower-dimensional space, which can be useful for tasks such as clustering, classification, and visualization.

## Features
- Load and process embeddings from different sources
- Visualize embeddings using various techniques (e.g., t-SNE, PCA)
- Interactive plots for better exploration of the data
- Support for different types of embeddings (e.g., word embeddings, sentence embeddings)

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
